I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Harvard Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology/the Broad Institute, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Jason Buenrostro](https://www.buenrostrolab.com/). Prior to my postdoc, I did my PhD at Princeton with the generous support of an [NIH F31 fellowship](https://grantome.com/grant/NIH/F31-AR075398-01) where I worked under the mentorship of [Jared Toettcher](https://scholar.princeton.edu/toettcherlab/home). I earned my BA at Harvard where I majored in chemistry, physics, and mathematics and minored in biology.
